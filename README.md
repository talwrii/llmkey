# LLM Key
LLM Key makes it easy to use an LLM, like chatgpt or grok, throughout your desktop by adding shortcuts that run everywhere.

The most basic use case is form asking an LLM questions when they come to mind. LLM Key will call the LLM in the background and popup a window when it is done.  It also copies the answer to the clipboard to be pasted straight away.

You can also copy text to the clipboard and use it in LLM queries.
